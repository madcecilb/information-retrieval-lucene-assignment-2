Assignment 1.2

Program your own web search engine using Apache Lucene.
Your program should be able to ...
 crawl arbitrary webpages recursively, starting at a seed URL entered into the Java
console. Additionally, a user has to be able to specify the crawling depth (recursion depth).
 parse and index each crawled webpage. You may use jsoup
in order to get the title and visible text of a webpage.
 print a ranked list of relevant webpages given some query entered into the Java console. The output should contain the first 10 most relevant webpages, their rank, title, URL and relevance score.


During development, please make sure not to spam webpages with a large number of requests. If in doubt, use the homepage of our university http://www.ovgu.de/ unimagdeburg/en/ as a seed.
